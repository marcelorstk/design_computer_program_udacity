This repository is related to the course Design of Computer Programs taugh by Peter Norvig in Udacity.
Here I'll post all programs and exercises made in classes as a way to help me learn

- Leason 1: Winning Poker Hands

Here we follow the steps of building a program that generate and avaliate poker hands (basically a sketch of a poker game) learning
   - Steps of the design process and developing for clarity and generality.
   - Nice ways to use python build-in library and using generators to create python objects
   - How to implement tests
   - Design tradeoffs
The poker_game.py is where the functions of the game were writen, poker_test.py where we create tests, dealer.py the functio that create poker hands and finally hand_percentage.py calculate (from our code) the percentage of deals of each poker hand.
